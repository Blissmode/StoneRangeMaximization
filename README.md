# StoneRangeMaximization
An algorithm to compute the parameters that maximise distance a stone dropped from an aeroplane can travel. We introduce Euler method and 4th order RK method to solve the complex real world problem in less than 650 iterations which can be considered as a huge achievement given the complexity of the problem.

This project is a result of combined effort of N Krithick Santhosh, Annanya Singh and Hariharan Ravichandran who are third year students of the department of Aerospace Engineering from the Department of Aerospace Engineering in IIT Kharagpur under professor Dr. N. K. Peyada.
